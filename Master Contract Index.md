# Operan: Master Contract Index
Last Updated: 2026-06-11 (LiteLLM embeddings in 07; gate enforcement in 03; persistence in 07/09/11; platform live on k8s)
Owner: You (Human Orchestrator)
Project: Operan — Agentic Department Operating System (ADOS)

## Platform Event Bus & Security Hardening (2026-06-10)

All six implemented modules (01–05, 08) now share one event-publishing standard:
- **Kafka only** via `segmentio/kafka-go` v0.4.51 — Module 02 was migrated off AMQP/RabbitMQ
  (topics `operan.iam.{event}` keyed by tenant ID; `streadway/amqp` removed; AsyncAPI 02
  servers updated to Kafka)
- **Log-only fallback** in every module when no broker is configured — a down broker
  degrades to warnings, never breaks API responses
- **JWT fail-fast**: every module refuses to start when its JWT secret is unset or the
  known default value
- Module 02 startup fixes: removed duplicate `/health` registration (boot panic) and
  exempted `/health` + `/ready` from the auth/tenant middleware chain
- Module 04 Helm chart fixed: it set `EVENT_BROKER_URL`, which the service never read;
  now sets `EVENT_BUS_HOST`/`EVENT_BUS_PORT`/`EVENT_BUS_PROTO`

~~Outstanding: live end-to-end publish verification~~ — DONE 2026-06-11 on the
single-node microk8s cluster (namespace `operan`): demo.sh 24/24 with real
Kafka feeding Module 11.

## Platform Integrations (2026-06-11)

- **Real embeddings (Module 07)**: search now vectorizes through the cluster
  LiteLLM gateway (`litellm.deep-research.svc:4000`, model
  `qwen3-embedding-4b`, 2560 dims); cosine ranking over real embeddings,
  token overlap only as no-gateway fallback. Qwen LLM
  (`Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`) is available on the same gateway for Module 12.
- **Gate enforcement (Module 03, US-402)**: `internal/gates` consumes
  `operan.supervision.gate.raised/responded`; approve resumes and reject
  fails the originating human task (correlation: approval `request_id` =
  orchestrator task ID). Interventions remain informational — Module 09's
  contract defines no intervention AsyncAPI channel.
- **Restart persistence (Modules 07/09/11)**: JSON snapshots every 10s plus
  on shutdown to `MODULE0X_DATA_DIR`; in k8s this is a hostPath
  (`/var/lib/operan/<service>`) with an init-chown for the non-root runtime.
  Modules 01/02/04/05/08 still hold state purely in memory — same pattern
  applies if needed; demo.sh repopulates them in seconds.

## Demo Environment (2026-06-11)

`deploy/demo/` holds the customer-demo stack: docker-compose with all nine
implemented services + single-node Kafka (KRaft, auto-create topics), one
shared `DEMO_JWT_SECRET`, and `demo.sh` — a scripted end-to-end flow
(tenant → agent → template → memory search → approval gate → tool →
observability) with PASS/FAIL per step.

The script was validated at 24/24 against all nine services running locally
in log-only mode; the Kafka-fed observability counts populate once the
compose stack runs with a real broker. Validation surfaced and fixed four
more probe/packaging bugs:
- Modules 01, 03, 04, 05 served `/health` behind the auth middleware (or
  not at all) — all four now expose an unauthenticated liveness probe
- Module 03's Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK invoked a nonexistent `healthcheck`
  subcommand and its `scratch` runtime had no wget — runtime moved to
  alpine with a real probe (module 01's `scratch` image likewise)

JWT claim requirements for cross-module tokens (demo.sh mints these):
`iss=operan-tenant-control-plane` (module 01 validates issuer),
`role` singular (module 04 RBAC), `roles` array (modules 08/09/11), `sub`, `exp`.

## Platform Standards Refactoring (In Progress)
Goal: Refactor all v1 OpenAPI contracts to adhere to strict Operan platform standards:
- Security: `BearerAuth` (JWT) + `X-Tenant-ID` (apiKey header)
- Pagination: `page`, `page_size`, `has_more` (replacing `limit`/`offset`)
- Error handling: Standard `Error` schema (`{ code: int, message: string, request_id: uuid }`) applied to all 4xx/5xx responses
- Schema integrity: `additionalProperties: false` on all request/response schemas
- Tags: Capitalized consistently (e.g., `Vectors`, `Search`, `Agents`)
**Progress:**

### Module 03 — Implementation Notes

**Contract counts:** 54 OpenAPI operations · 37 AsyncAPI events · Multi-stack orchestration (LangGraph, Temporal, Ray, Celery/Kafka)

**Implementation status:**
- Handlers: `handler_workflows.go` (Create, List, Get, Pause, Resume, Cancel, Checkpoint, State, Replay)
- Stores: `WorkflowStore`, `ScheduleStore`, `AgentStore` (AgentAvailability/AgentAssignment), `EscalationStore`, `RetryRecordStore`, `StackHealthStore` — all in-memory with tenant isolation
- Middleware: `JWTAuth` (HMAC-S256 with JWT_SECRET env var), `TenantContext`, `TraceID`, `RequestID`, `Logger`
- Events: Publisher with 25+ typed publish methods using `operan.orchestration.{stack}.{entity}.{event}` topic format
- Deployment: Dockerfile (multi-stage, non-root user), Helm chart (deployment, service, configmap, ingress, HPA)

**Test coverage:** Full test suite across handler, middleware, store, and events packages. All tests passing. Key test scenarios: CRUD operations, tenant isolation, status transitions, pagination, JWT auth validation, middleware chaining, event topic naming.

**Known Bugs / Issues:**

| # | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | ~~Event publisher is a stub~~ — RESOLVED: real Kafka broker (segmentio/kafka-go) with SASL/TLS support and log-only fallback | `events/kafka_broker.go` | ~~P0~~ Done |
| 2 | No database backend — all stores are in-memory | All `store/` files | P1 |
| 3 | JWT auth uses local secret (MVP) — should delegate to Module 02 IAM | `middleware/middleware.go` | P1 |
| 4 | AgentStore manages availability/assignment only — actual Agent definitions belong to Module 04 | `store/agents.go` | Info |

**Module 03 as style reference:** Module 03's implementation demonstrates the multi-stack orchestration pattern. Contract files: `openapi-03-agent-orchestration.yaml` (54 ops, 18 path groups), `asyncapi-03-agent-orchestration.yaml` (37 channels, 39 schemas).

#### Module 04 — Agent Registry: ~85%

| PRD Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Agent versioning | ✅ | Full CRUD + promote; semver enforced; Archived status supported |
| Capability indexing | ✅ | CRUD implemented; structured scores stored; IndexCapabilities returns 202 async |
| Permissions | ✅ | Full JWT auth chain + tenant isolation via JWT context + RBAC middleware (RequireRole, RequireAdmin) |
| Dependency management | ⚠️ Partial | CRUD only; no DAG resolution, no cycle detection |
| Runtime constraints | ⚠️ Partial | Stored on Agent object; not enforced at runtime |
| Cost profiles | ⚠️ Partial | Stored but Module 17 integration missing |
| Agent lifecycle | ✅ | Full CRUD + Deprecate + Archive with event publishing |
| Agent search | ✅ | SearchAgents with tenant context enforcement (fixed from body-reading) |
| Agent caching | ✅ | In-memory LRU cache (1000 items) with eviction callbacks and event-driven invalidation |

**Contract counts:** 16 OpenAPI operations · 8 AsyncAPI channels · JSON Schema with 20 definitions

**Implementation status:**
- Handlers: `handler_registry.go` (List, Create, Get, Update, Deprecate, Archive + CRUD for versions, capabilities, dependencies + search, promote, index-capabilities)
- Stores: 4 in-memory stores (AgentStore, VersionStore, CapabilityStore, DependencyStore) — AgentStore has tenant isolation; others do not
- Middleware: `JWTAuth` (HMAC-S256 with JWT_SECRET env var), `ChainJWTAuth` for Chain compatibility, `ExtractTenant` (checks JWT context first, then header), `TraceID`, `RequestID`, `Logger`, `RequireRole`, `RequireAdmin`
- Events: Publisher with 8 typed publish methods using `operan.agent-registry.{entity}.{event}` topic format; wired to Kafka broker via `events.NewPublisherWithConfig()`
- Cache: `internal/cache/` — thread-safe LRU cache (1000 items max) with eviction callbacks
- Broker: `internal/broker/` — real async KafkaProducer (segmentio/kafka-go; delivery failures logged via completion callback) + MockProducer for tests
- Context keys: `internal/ctxkeys/` — TenantID, UserID, UserRole, TraceID, RequestID (Get/Set functions)
- Test coverage: 148 tests, 72.6% overall (handlers 58.5%, middleware 83.8%, cache 98.2%, broker 97.8%, config 100.0%, ctxkeys 100.0%, events 96.0%, store 77.7%)

**Fixed issues (from architectural review 2026-05-28):**

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | `DependencyType` enum missing `hard` | ✅ Fixed — added to JSON Schema and AsyncAPI |
| 2 | `SearchAgents` bypasses tenant context | ✅ Fixed — reads `tenant_id` from context (JWT) |
| 3 | Routes for `AgentByID` and `VersionByID` not wrapped with `ExtractTenant` | ✅ Fixed — all routes use JWT middleware in main chain |
| 4 | No event publishing — 4 of 8 AsyncAPI events have no Go struct | ✅ Fixed — all 8 AsyncAPI events now have typed publish methods + Kafka wiring |
| 5 | Base path `/agents` should be `/registry/agents` | ✅ Fixed — routes use `/registry/agents/` |
| 6 | `MemoryAccess` stored as `[]string` | ⚠️ Not fixed — stored as-is in model |
| 7 | `CostProfile` has 3 fields vs 6 in OpenAPI contract | ⚠️ Not fixed — DTO removed, using raw model |
| 8 | `Agent` required fields misaligned | ✅ Fixed — response types align with OpenAPI |
| 9 | `DependencyRequest` handler struct mismatch | ✅ Fixed — `Type` → `Description` |
| 10 | Config struct defined but never wired | ✅ Fixed — wired in `main.go` |
| 11 | Version/Capability/Dependency stores lack tenant isolation | ⚠️ Not fixed — cross-tenant by design per PRD |
| 12 | Tests use `dependency_type: "direct"` not in enum | ✅ Fixed — tests use `[hard, soft, optional]` |

**Known Issues (remaining):**

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | No database backend — all stores are in-memory | P1 |
| 2 | JWT auth uses local secret (MVP) — should delegate to Module 02 IAM | P1 |
| 3 | Agent Store has tenant isolation; Version/Capability/Dependency stores do not | Medium |
| 4 | Event struct names: 3 of 8 still mismatch AsyncAPI operationIds | Low |

---

### Module 04 — Contract vs Implementation Gaps

**Base Path:** Implementation routes use `/registry/agents` — matches OpenAPI structure.

**Store Tenant Isolation:** Only `AgentStore` has tenant-scoped `byTenant` index. `VersionStore`, `CapabilityStore`, `DependencyStore` are cross-tenant by design (per PRD).

**Missing Agent Fields in Handler DTOs:** `objectives`, `supported_languages`, `current_version_id`, `department_id`, `description` (Agent-level).

**Event Struct Name Mismatches (3 of 8 remaining):**
| AsyncAPI operationId | Go struct | Status |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|
| `AgentRegistered` | `AgentRegistered` | ✅ Fixed — was `AgentCreated` |
| `AgentCapabilitiesUpdated` | *(none)* | ❌ Missing |
| `AgentVersionCreated` | `AgentVersionCreated` | ✅ Match |
| `AgentPromoted` | `AgentVersionPromoted` | ❌ Mismatch |
| `AgentDeprecated` | `AgentDeprecated` | ✅ Fixed — was missing |
| `AgentArchived` | `AgentArchived` | ✅ Fixed — was missing, handler implemented |
| `DependencyAdded` | *(none)* | ❌ Missing |
| `DependencyRemoved` | *(none)* | ❌ Missing |

**ArchiveAgent handler:** Implemented — `DELETE /registry/agents/{id}`, sets status to `archived`, publishes `AgentArchived` event.

---

### Module 05 — Department Template Engine: ~95%

| PRD Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Template CRUD | ✅ | Full CRUD for department templates with versioning |
| Custom Templates | ✅ | User-defined custom templates with flexible content |
| Version Management | ✅ | Immutable version snapshots with automatic incrementing |
| Template Cloning | ✅ | Create variants of existing templates |
| Deployment Pipeline | ✅ | Multi-stage deployment (select → configure → connect_data → provision_memory → deploy_swarm → operational) |
| Event Publishing | ✅ | 8 AsyncAPI channels for all lifecycle operations |
| Tenant Isolation | ✅ | Full multi-tenancy with per-tenant data isolation |
| REST API | ✅ | OpenAPI 3.0.3-compliant REST API |

**Contract counts:** 15 OpenAPI operations · 8 AsyncAPI channels · JSON Schema with 15+ definitions

**Implementation status:**
- Handlers: 5 handler files (`templates.go`, `custom_templates.go`, `deployments.go`, `versions.go`, `helpers.go`) + `router.go`
- Stores: 4 in-memory stores (`TemplateStore`, `CustomTemplateStore`, `DeploymentStore`, `VersionStore`) — all with tenant isolation via `byTenant` index
- Middleware: `JWTAuth` (HMAC-S256 with JWT_SECRET env var), `ChainJWTAuth` for Chain compatibility, `ExtractTenant`, `TraceID`, `RequestID`, `Logger`
- Events: Publisher with 8 typed publish methods using `operan.templates.template.{event}` topic format; LogBroker for development (broker channel for production)
- Context keys: `internal/ctxkeys/` — TenantID, UserID, TraceID, RequestID (Get/Set functions)
- Test coverage: 70 tests, all passing (config 100%, middleware 94.1%, store 72.0%, events 77.3%, handlers 42.3%)
- Deployment: Dockerfile (multi-stage build, non-root user), Helm chart (deployment, service, ingress, HPA, serviceaccount)
- Documentation: README.md, HANDOVER.md (comprehensive implementation handover for review)

**Deployment artifacts:**
- `Dockerfile` — Multi-stage build, Go 1.22-alpine, non-root user (operan:1001)
- `chart/` — Helm chart with deployment, service (ClusterIP:8005), ingress (TLS), HPA (CPU:70%), serviceaccount
- `manifest.json` — Platform manifest with port 8005, dependencies on modules 01,03,04,07,10,11

**Security implementation:**
- HMAC-S256 JWT validation (all endpoints except `/health`)
- Tenant ID extracted from JWT `sub` claim + validated against `X-Tenant-ID` header
- All stores filter queries by TenantID for cross-tenant isolation
- UUID document IDs + TenantID field per document
- Input validation (Content-Type enforcement, required fields, JSON unmarshal errors)

**Test coverage breakdown:**

| Package | Tests | Coverage |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `config` | 8 | 100.0% |
| `ctxkeys` | 0 | n/a (type constants) |
| `events` | 13 | 77.3% |
| `handlers` | 15 | 42.3% |
| `middleware` | 11 | 94.1% |
| `store` | 22 | 72.0% |
| **Total** | **70** | **42.3% overall** |

**Known Issues:**

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | No database backend — all stores are in-memory | P1 |
| 2 | ~~Event publishing uses LogBroker~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-10: Kafka broker wired via `MODULE05_EVENT_BROKER_URL` (LogBroker remains the dev default) | ~~P1~~ Done |
| 3 | Handler coverage at 42.3% — some edge cases untested (concurrent requests, large payloads, malformed UUIDs) | Medium |
| 4 | No rate limiting middleware | Medium |

---

### Module 07 — Memory Fabric: Implementation Notes (2026-06-10)

**Contract counts:** 10 OpenAPI operations · 5 AsyncAPI channels (Kafka: `operan.memory.vector.{ingested,searched,updated,deleted,garbage_collected}`)

| PRD Requirement (Phase 1 MVP) | Status | Notes |
|------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Store/retrieve semantic embeddings (US-301) | ✅ | Batch ingest, CRUD, cosine similarity when embeddings supplied |
| Tenant-specific vector isolation (US-302) | ✅ | All stores tenant-scoped; verified by tests |
| Episodic execution history (US-303) | ✅ | All 5 lifecycle events publish to Kafka with platform envelope |

**Implementation:** structure mirrors Module 08 (config / ctxkeys / events / handlers / middleware / store). JWT fail-fast at startup; Kafka via `MODULE07_EVENT_BROKER_URL` (log-only default); tenant-keyed event partitioning. Test coverage: config 100%, store 90.5%, handlers 85.5%, middleware 80%, events 72% — all passing with `-race`. Deployment: Dockerfile (multi-stage, non-root, port 8007), Helm chart, manifest.json.

**Search semantics:** cosine similarity when the request carries `query_vector` and stored vectors have embeddings; otherwise deterministic token-overlap with ≥4-char prefix tolerance ("demo" matches "demos"). Real embedding generation is a Module 12 dependency.

**Known limitations:** in-memory stores (P1); text search is a placeholder until Module 12 (P1); JWT secret local, not delegated to Module 02 (P1); retention policies stored but not auto-enforced — GC is manual via `POST /gc` (Medium). AsyncAPI 07 servers updated from RabbitMQ to Kafka as part of the platform event-bus standardization.

### Module 11 — Observability: Implementation Notes (2026-06-10)

**Contract counts:** 8 OpenAPI operations · 5 AsyncAPI channels published (`operan.observability.{metric.recorded, trace.span, trace.flush, alert.fired, health.status_change}`) · consumes all platform topics from modules 01–08

| PRD Requirement (Phase 1 MVP) | Status | Notes |
|------------------------------|--------|-------|
| View workflow execution traces (US-501) | ✅ | Kafka consumer groups platform events into traces by correlationId; GET /spans + GET /traces/{id} |
| Token/cost metrics per tenant (US-502) | ✅ | POST/GET /metrics with type/name/source/time-range filters, tenant-isolated; `operan.events.consumed` counter auto-recorded |

**Implementation:** structure mirrors Modules 07/08. The differentiator is `internal/consumer`: one Kafka reader per platform topic (consumer group `module11-observability`) ingests every event into a span (trace = correlationId), a counter metric, a component-health upsert, and — for `.failed` events — a warning alert. Envelope per the AsyncAPI contract is carried in message **headers** (unlike module 07, whose contract embeds it in payloads). Coverage: store 92%, config 82.6%, handlers 81.6%, consumer 67.4% (uncovered = live-Kafka paths) — all `-race` clean. Smoke-tested: auth, metric record/query, tenant health, fail-fast.

**Route note:** the contract's `GET /health` is *tenant system health* (auth-required). Service liveness is `GET /healthz` (no auth) — probes and the Helm chart point there.

**Platform fix shipped with this module:** topic names in modules 01, 05, 08 contained characters invalid in Kafka (`operan/events/...` slashes) or lacked the platform prefix (`tenant.*`). All renamed to dotted form: `operan.tenant.*`, `operan.templates.template.*`, `operan.templates.custom_template.*`, `operan.tools.*`. Without this, those modules' publishes would have been rejected by a real broker.

**Known limitations:** in-memory stores (P1); JWT secret local (P1); no alert rules engine — alerts only from `.failed` events (Medium); health derives from event flow only — silence ≠ unhealthy (Medium); consumed-event spans have duration 0; `trace.flush` not wired (Low).

### Module 09 — Human Supervision: Implementation Notes (2026-06-11)

**Contract counts:** 20 OpenAPI operations · 5 AsyncAPI channels (`operan.supervision.gate.{raised,responded,escalated,timeout}`, `operan.supervision.policy.violation_detected`)

| PRD Requirement (Phase 1 MVP) | Status | Notes |
|------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Approve/reject agent actions (US-401) | ✅ | Full gate lifecycle: create → queue → approve/reject/delegate, with threshold rules and lazy expiry; HITL answers can decide gates |
| Approval gates before execution (US-402) | ⚠️ Partial | Gates + events implemented; Module 03 must consume gate/intervention events to actually block execution (integration pending) |

**Implementation:** structure mirrors Modules 07/11. Decision rules: first approval approves / first rejection rejects by default; `threshold` type honors `min_approvals`/`max_rejections`; expiry is lazy (read/action transitions to `expired` + publishes `gate.timeout`); terminal states return 409. Merged review queue (approvals + escalations + interventions, type/user filters) and severity-weighted risk dashboard (0–100). Module 09's contract error schema (`{error:{code:string,...}}`) differs from 07/11 and is honored. Coverage: config 100%, handlers 76.5%, store 79.9% — all `-race` clean. Smoke-tested end-to-end: gate raised → queue → approved with `gate.raised`/`gate.responded`/`policy.violation_detected` all publishing.

**Known limitations:** in-memory stores (P1); JWT secret local (P1); no background expiry timer — timeout only fires on touch (Medium); interventions recorded but not enforced until Module 03 consumes them (Medium); `conditional` approval type has no expression engine (Medium). AsyncAPI 09 servers updated AMQP → Kafka.

### Orphan Files (Drafts — unnumbered) — ✅ Cleaned up

All unnumbered draft contracts and `.bak` files were removed (git history retains
them). Module READMEs that pointed at the old unnumbered specs were repointed to the
canonical numbered specs (`openapi-<NN>-<name>.yaml` / `schema-<NN>-<name>.json`).
Module 20's OpenAPI now has `operationId` on all 14 operations.

**Removed OpenAPI drafts:** `openapi-arabic-language.yaml`, `openapi-enterprise-connector.yaml`, `openapi-cost-governance.yaml`, `openapi-knowledge.yaml`, `openapi-messaging.yaml`, `openapi-ml.yaml`, `openapi-observability.yaml`, `openapi-governance.yaml`, `openapi-supervision.yaml`, `openapi-tools.yaml`, `openapi-memory.yaml`, `openapi-ingestion.yaml`, `openapi-departments.yaml`, `openapi-registry.yaml`, `openapi-tenant.yaml`

**Removed Schema drafts:** `schema-enterprise-connector.json`, `schema-cost-governance.json`, `schema-knowledge.json`, `schema-workflows.json`, `schema-messaging.json`, `schema-ml.json`, `schema-observability.json`, `schema-governance.json`, `schema-supervision.json`, `schema-tools.json`, `schema-memory.json`

**Removed `.bak` files:** `openapi-19-knowledge-marketplace.yaml.bak`, `asyncapi-19-knowledge-marketplace.yaml.bak`, `schema-19-knowledge-marketplace.json.bak` — misassigned to module 19; marketplace belongs to module 15

### Cross-Spec Inconsistencies — Module 04 (Resolved)

| Field | OpenAPI | JSON Schema | AsyncAPI | Fix |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|-----|
| `DependencyType` enum | `[hard, soft, optional]` | `[hard, soft, optional]` | `[hard, soft, optional]` | ✅ Harmonized — added `hard` to JSON Schema and AsyncAPI |

### Cross-Spec Action Items — Module 04

1. **Agent required fields** — OpenAPI requires `[id, name, role, tenant_id, status, capabilities, tools, created_at]`; JSON Schema requires `[id, name, role, tenant_id, status, capabilities, tools]`. Recommendation: align JSON Schema to OpenAPI by adding `created_at` to `Agent.required`.
2. **CostProfile shape** — OpenAPI `CostProfile` has 6 fields (`base_rate_per_minute`, `max_budget`, `cost_threshold`, `currency`, `billing_tier`, `cost_center`). Go DTO `CostProfile` has 3. Contract is the source of truth — implement full struct.
3. **MemoryAccess shape** — OpenAPI `MemoryAccess` has `[scope, access_level, vector_store, index, ttl_minutes]`. Go DTO stores as `[]string`. Align DTO to contract.
4. **DependencyRequest** — OpenAPI `DependencyRequest` has `[agent_id, depends_on, dependency_type, description]`. Go handler struct uses `[AgentID, DependsOn, DependencyType, Type]`. Rename `Type` → `Description`.
5. **Event struct names** — 5 of 8 Go event structs do not match AsyncAPI operationIds. Either rename Go structs to match AsyncAPI operationIds (recommended) or update AsyncAPI operationIds to match Go structs.

### Global Constants (Copy-Paste These Everywhere)

- Tenant ID format: `uuid-v4`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer {jwt}`
- Error format: RFC 7807 Problem Details
- Trace ID header: `X-Trace-Id: {uuid}`
- Timestamp format: ISO 8601 UTC

### Module 02 — Implementation Notes

**Contract counts:** 33 OpenAPI operations · 9 AsyncAPI events · JSON Schema with 10 top-level definitions · Integration graph edge present

**Implementation status:**
- Handlers: 13 handler files (users, roles, audit_rbac, sso, ldap, ad, delegations, mfa, abac, identity)
- Stores: 9 in-memory stores with tenant isolation (`sync.RWMutex` + per-tenant maps)
- Middleware: `AuthValidator` (RSA via JWKS + HMAC fallback), `TenantInjector`, `TraceInjector`, `SessionReplayCapture`, `JWKSCache`
- Events: Publisher with 15+ typed publish methods — Kafka via `segmentio/kafka-go` (topics `operan.iam.{event}`, tenant-keyed; log-only when `IAM_EVENT_BROKER_URL` unset)
- Authentik client: Full REST v3 API wrapper (Users, Groups, Applications, Tokens, OAuth2, SAML, LDAP, SCIM, RBAC, Tenants)
- Provisioner: Helm and Docker Compose per-tenant Authentik instances

**Test coverage:** 139 test functions across handler/middleware/store packages. No integration tests (`tests/` directory is empty).

**Module 02 Known Bugs / Issues (see HANDOVER-MODULE-02-TO-MODULE-03.md for full list):**

| # | Issue | Location | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | ~~Event publisher is a stub~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-10: migrated to Kafka (topics `operan.iam.{event}`, tenant-keyed, retry+backoff; AMQP removed) | `events/events.go`, `events/kafka.go` | ~~P0~~ Done |
| 2 | `generateSecureToken` / `generateSecurePassword` not cryptographically secure | `authentik/provisioner.go` | P0 |
| 3 | Query string sanitization defined but not wired into session replay capture | `middleware/session_replay.go` | P0 |
| 4 | Possible compilation errors — missing accessor methods (`OAuth2API`, `SAMLAPI`, `Groups`, `Users`, `Call`) | Multiple handlers | P1 |
| 5 | Two `AuditStore` types — `store/audit.go` vs `handler/handler_audit_rbac.go` naming collision | Naming | P1 |
| 6 | JWKS cache refresh ignores issuer URL parameter after construction | `middleware/jwks.go` | P2 |
| 7 | DelegationHandler.findUserUUID does full user list for every lookup | `handler_delegations.go` | P2 |
| 8 | MFA Disable handler has redundant/erroneous API call | `handler_mfa.go` | P2 |
| 9 | No database backend — all stores are in-memory | All `store/` files | P1 |

**Module 02 as style reference:** Module 02's OpenAPI contract (`openapi-02-identity-access.yaml`) is used as a gold standard for IAM patterns. It is NOT a platform-standards-refactored contract (it predates the refactoring initiative). Modules 05–16 were refactored to use the standards, but Module 02 was kept as-is for backward compatibility since it defines the IAM patterns.

Use these as reference for Kafka event/topic naming (platform standard since 2026-06-10; dotted topics, e.g. `operan.iam.user.created`):
- **Module 03** (`asyncapi-03-agent-orchestration.yaml`) — 37 events; multi-stack format: `operan.orchestration.{stack}.{entity}.{event}`
- **Module 04** (`asyncapi-04-agent-registry.yaml`) — 8 events
- **Module 06** (`asyncapi-06-knowledge-ingestion.yaml`) — 7 events
- **Module 07** (`asyncapi-07-memory-fabric.yaml`) — 5 events
- **Module 08** (`asyncapi-08-tool-execution.yaml`) — 6 events
